# Aura
 Messaging app made for Final Project in Mobile Software Development for Android class.
 This messaging app allows user authentication and communication through live chat rooms and private messaging. IBM's Tone
 Analyzer API is used to determine whether a message is happy, sad, or angry and then each group and user aura is updated
 accordingly. Therefore, this app can keep a running track of every individual and chats' overall current mood.
 
 Each topic room has a name, image, description, aura, and owner.
 Each user has a name, image, and aura.
 
 gradle files and API keys removed for cleanliness and personal safety, so this repository will not function upon download.

Front end was handled by my partner Kirtana.
