# Aura
 Messaging app made for Final Project in Mobile Software Development for Android class.
 This messaging app allows users authentication and communication through live chat rooms and private messaging. IBM's Tone
 Analyzer API is used to determine whether a message is happy, sad, or angry and then each group and user aura is updated
 accordingly. Therefore, this app can keep a running track of every individual and chats' overall current mood.

Front end was handled by my partner Kirtana.
